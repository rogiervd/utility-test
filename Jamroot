# Options file for Boost.Build.

# Boost.Build is a make-like system. The main command is "bjam".
# Calling "bjam" builds the main project.
#   (A no-op for include-only libraries.)
# Calling "bjam test" builds and runs the unit tests for the main project.
# Calling "bjam test_all" builds and runs the unit tests for all projects in
# this project.

# The structure of this file is shared by Rogier van Dalen's C++ projects.

# Make all builds and tests end up in "./bin".

project : build-dir ./bin ;

##### Project-specific settings.

# Declare project id's and relate them to directories.
# This will usually be a list like
#   use-project /project-id : ./project-dir ;

use-project /meta : ./meta ;
use-project /utility : ./utility ;

##### Build targets.

# Convenience definition so that "bjam" will build the main project.
# Reference the main project's directory, probably with
#   build-project ./project-dir ;

build-project ./utility ;


##### Explicit targets (which are only run on request).
explicit test ;
explicit test_all ;

# Convenience definition so that "bjam test" will test the main project.
# Reference the project's test target, probably with
#   alias test : /project-id//test ;

alias test : /utility//test ;

# Convenience definition so that "bjam test_all" will test all included
# projects.
# Reference all projects' test targets, probably with
#   alias test_all : /project1-id//test /project2-id//test ;
# Do include the main project as well.

alias test_all : /utility//test /meta//test ;

# Rule that uses the appropriate version of <library>/boost//python.
# It seems that there is /boost//python and /boost//python3.
# The difference is at link time.
# To be able to test with both Python versions, it makes sense to automatically
# choose the correct library depending on the version on Python interpreter that
# is to be used.
# If you add
#     <conditional>@appropriate_boost_python
# to the list of requirements, this will be turned into
#     <library>/boost//python
# or
#     <library>/boost//python3
# depending on the version of Python (the value of the <python> property).
